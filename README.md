## 100 Days Of Code Challenge
The 100 Days of Code Challenge is one put forth by Alexander Kallaway to encourage people to learn how to code. The Challenge is simple, code for at least an hour each day for 100 days. Thousands have taken on this challenge and we wanted to do our part in making it a little easier (and hopefully more fun). To learn more about the challenge visite Kallaway's website for it here: https://www.100daysofcode.com/

<br>

## Features

-   **Daily Logs**: Log daily progress, metrics, and milestones to see how far you have progressed over the 100 days.

-   **Milestones**: Work towards milestones while coding to unlock badges for your accomplishments along the way.

-   **Dashboard**: Quickly view your overall milestone progress, recent logs and overall code time throughout the challenge.

-   **Share**: Easily share your logs, milestones, and dashboard progress to twitter.

-   **Online Backups**: Log in to Code Time and we’ll back up your logs and milestones so you can pick up where you left off on another computer.

<br />

## Getting started

### **1. Create a Log Entry**

Logs are diary entries for your 100 Days of Code challenge to help you stay on track and remember all the things you have accomplished. Each log entry has a title, description, and set of links in them that you can fill out when completing the log. Logs are also automatically populated with your code time, number of keystrokes, and lines added for that day of coding.

    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Add+Log+Navigation.png" alt="Navigate to Add Log page" />
</p>

Navigate to the Add Log page by clicking View Logs in the left column's 100 Days of Code section in the Software.com Code Time plugin and click the Add Log link at the top of the screen. You can only add a log entry once per day. Any coding metrics recorded after that will be automatically updated in the log.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Add+log+Form.png" alt="Add Log page" />
</p>

Logging your daily progress is the cornerstone of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, so this plugin makes it as easy as possible. Just input a title, description, and resource links into the Add Log form and we will generate a log for you that includes your code metrics and milestones earned that day.

<br>

### **2. View Logs**

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
    <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/View+Log+Page.png" alt="View Log page" />
</p>

When your logs are submitted, they are added to this page where you can view your title, description, links, code metrics, and milestones for that day. 

If you forget to create a log for a day that you worked, don’t fret, we created one for you. It will appear in your logs as “No Title”, allowing you to edit that log with what you worked on the day you missed.

The title, description, and links for any log entry can be edited at any time.

<br>

### **3. View Milestones**

To open the Milestones page, click View Milestones below the View Logs button in the left column of VS Code. 

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Milestones+Page.png" alt="View Milestones page" />
</p>

Milestones are fun, sharable badges that you can earn while completing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Milestones are automatically earned for things you do everyday while completing the challenge. For example, you earn a milestone for coding a total of 10 hours while on the challenge, typing 42,162 total keystrokes, or even just coding in a new programming language.

<br>

### **4. View Dashboard**

To navigate to the dashboard, click the View Dashboard button in the 100 Days of Code section of the Code Time plugin.

<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/Dashboard+Page.png" alt="View Dashboard page" />
</p>

The Dashboard is where you can look at the overall progress you have made through the challenge. It displays a few aggregate code metrics for the challenge, the most recent Logs and Milestones achieved, and generates a graph of your code time throughout the challenge at the bottom of the page.

<br>

### **5. Share Your Progress**

The second tenet of the 100 Days of Code challenge is sharing your progress. 
We believe that even minor progress is still progress and encourage you to share everyday. 
Each milestone is also sharable, encouraging you to push on through the challenge to get the next milestone.


<p align="center" style="margin: 0 10%">
  <img src="https://100-days-of-code.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Readme/First+Day+Full+Tweet.png" alt="Share Log Twitter" />
</p>

Each log entry has a share button that will allow you to directly tweet your progress along with your daily code time metrics. 

<br>

</p>

Similarly you can tweet out any milestone that you achieve throughout the challenge.
